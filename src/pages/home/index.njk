      <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹. Welcome! My name is Radion. This is a place where I share my thoughts about design, development, and other tech stuff. It might include instructions for setting up a Linux server, how to visualize data with Three.js, or writing your own plugin for Figma. Iâ€™m writing about things that capture my attention. It could be useful for you too. Itâ€™s like my journey of discovering this world.</p>
      <p>Reach me at <a href="mailto:hey@radion.dev">hey@radion.dev</a> if you have any questions or suggestions or visit <a href="https://radion.dev">radion.dev</a> to find other ways to follow or contact me.</p>
